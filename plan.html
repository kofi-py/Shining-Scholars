            <h2>Set Up a Bank Account</h2>
            <p>First, we'll set up a bank account to raise money. This will allow us to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build a school roof for teachers' stay</li>
                <li>Create a computer lab</li>
                <li>Establish a library</li>
                <li>Purchase a shipping container for items</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our bank account is already on our <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/akyease-dida-methodist-jhs"

            <h2>Donations Account</h2>
            <p>To streamline the process of contributing to our cause, we are establishing a dedicated donations account
                with the guidance of the reverend. This account will serve as a secure platform for monetary
                contributions, making it convenient for supporters to contribute from near and far.</p>

            <h2>The Barrel System</h2>
            <p> In the backyard of our house, we'll implement an efficient barrel system to manage physical donations.
                Four barrels will be dedicated to specific categories: one for writing utensils, one for clothes, one
                for books, and another for feminine health items. This organized approach will ensure that contributions
                are sorted appropriately. </p>

            <h2>Collection Stations for Donation Items</h2>
            <p>To facilitate the collection of physical donations, we will set up separate places for different types of
                items. These collection stations will be strategically located for easy drop-offs, allowing community
                members to contribute items such as clothing, books, writing utensils, and feminine health products.
                When we are done with donations, we will ship the items directly to the school and monitor the impact on
                the school, notifying donators of their impact.</p>
