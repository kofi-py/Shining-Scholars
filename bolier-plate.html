                <h2>Current Situation</h2>
                <p>This school doesn't have a computer lab. The government just gave them two keyboards to give the
                    students the feel of using a computer. However,they didn't give them an actual computer. This limits
                    the students' education, as they have limited access to imformation, which impacts their creativity
                    and preperation for the future.</p>

                <h2>Ideal Scenario</h2>
                <p>All students have access to sufficient keyboards for hands-on learning. There is also a board and an
                    extra computer for each student and a projector to follow along. Access to the computers increases
                    the student's education and increases their creativity.</p>

                <p>At the school, the teachers don't have a board to draw on! Their only source of drawing or
                    demonstrating something is the wall. The problem with not having a board is that it prohibits
                    interactive learning for the students.</p>

                <p>In this school, the desks are only meant to fit two people; however, the students have to sit in
                    groups of three. Worse, some students have to sit on the floor or stand. This limits the amount of
                    students learning.</p>

                    This allows for more students to learn and increases the students' education.</p>

                <p>The houses for the teachers look worn out and shabby. Here's the problem with this: the school is far
                    away from the city, and any teacher would NOT like to stay for a night, let alone an entire school
                    year, in these houses!</p>

                <h2>Current Situation</h2>
                <p>The kids really like to play soccer (a.k.a football as they call it). The only problem, though, is
                    that they can't cut the grass down; they don't have a lawnmower. Due to this, the grass in the field
                    gets so high, that the students aren't able to play sports. Not being able to go outdoors hinders
                    students' socialization with others. </p>
